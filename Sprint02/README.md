# 📊 Sprint 2 Project – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of **Sprint 2** in the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp.  
The focus of this sprint was to apply **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques using Python and begin working with real-world datasets.

The primary goals of this project were:
- ✅ Load and inspect a dataset.
- ✅ Perform exploratory data analysis to understand distributions and patterns.
- ✅ Handle missing values and outliers.
- ✅ Draw early insights and document findings.

## 🚀 Key Sections of the Notebook
You can explore the notebook directly in GitHub or open it in Jupyter to run the code.  
Here are the main sections of the notebook:

- [📦 **Data Loading & Initial Inspection**](EDA_sprint_2_project.ipynb)  
  Importing the dataset, reviewing columns, and checking data types.

- [📈 **Exploratory Visualizations**](EDA_sprint_2_project.ipynb)  
  Creating histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots to understand feature distributions and relationships.

- [🧹 **Data Cleaning**](EDA_sprint_2_project.ipynb)  
  Handling missing values, addressing outliers, and preparing data for analysis.

- [🔎 **Insights & Observations**](EDA_sprint_2_project.ipynb)  
  Summarizing key findings and trends discovered during EDA.
