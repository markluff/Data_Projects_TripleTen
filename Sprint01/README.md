📄 Sprint 1: Exploring TV Show Data
Project Title: Using Movie and TV Show Data to Begin Practicing Python Skills

🔍 Objective
This project explores a dataset of movies and TV shows to analyze trends during the "Golden Age" of television—beginning in 1999 with The Sopranos. The primary goal is to investigate how the number of user votes correlates with show ratings.

🧠 Skills Practiced
Python basics

Working with Jupyter Notebooks

Data loading and initial exploration

Data cleaning and preprocessing with pandas

Filtering and subsetting datasets

Sorting and basic descriptive statistics

📁 Dataset
File: movies_and_shows.csv

Content: Metadata on movies and shows, including title, type (TV or movie), release year, rating, and number of user votes.

🔬 Analysis Workflow
Data Overview:

Loaded data with pandas

Inspected structure, types, and basic statistics

Data Preprocessing:

Identified and handled missing or inconsistent values

Filtered the dataset to focus on TV shows only

Exploratory Analysis:

Analyzed relationships between the number of votes and ratings

Focused on shows released during or after 1999

💡 Key Findings
Highly-rated TV shows during the Golden Age typically also received a large number of votes.

A clear positive correlation was observed between user engagement (votes) and high ratings.
