# 📊 Sprint 1 Project – Basic Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of **Sprint 1** in the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp.  
The focus of this sprint was to build foundational skills in Python programming and begin developing a workflow for data analysis.

The primary goals of this project were:
- ✅ Practice basic Python syntax and operations.
- ✅ Work with lists, loops, and conditionals.
- ✅ Apply problem-solving skills to simple data tasks.
