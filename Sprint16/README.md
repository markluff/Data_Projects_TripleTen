# 🤝 Sprint 16 – Introduction to Unsupervised Learning

## 📌 Overview
Sprint 16 focused on the fundamentals of **unsupervised learning**, a branch of machine learning where models find patterns in data without labeled outcomes.

During this sprint, I explored key unsupervised learning concepts including:

- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together based on their features, such as with K-Means or hierarchical clustering.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual or rare data points that differ significantly from the majority of the data.

## 📚 What I Learned
- How clustering algorithms work and when to use them.
- Techniques to detect anomalies in datasets.
- The differences between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Practical applications of unsupervised learning in real-world scenarios.

## 📈 Next Steps
- Practice applying clustering algorithms on real datasets.
- Explore advanced anomaly detection methods.
- Understand dimensionality reduction techniques to complement unsupervised learning.
