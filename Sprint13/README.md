# ⏳ Sprint 13 Project – Time Series Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of **Sprint 13** in the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp.  
The focus of this sprint was to work with **time series data**, applying techniques to analyze trends, seasonality, and patterns over time.

The primary goals of this project were:
- ✅ Load and prepare time series datasets.
- ✅ Explore temporal trends, seasonality, and cyclic patterns.
- ✅ Apply smoothing and decomposition methods.
- ✅ Build and evaluate a simple forecasting model.

Here are the main sections of the notebook:

- [📦 **Data Import & Preprocessing**](Sprint_13_Time_Series.ipynb)  
  Loading the time series dataset, parsing dates, and setting up the index.

- [📈 **Exploratory Time Series Analysis**](Sprint_13_Time_Series.ipynb)  
  Plotting trends, examining seasonality, and identifying irregular components.

- [🔧 **Smoothing & Decomposition**](Sprint_13_Time_Series.ipynb)  
  Applying rolling averages, exponential smoothing, and decomposing the series.

- [🤖 **Forecasting & Evaluation**](Sprint_13_Time_Series.ipynb)  
  Building a simple predictive model, generating forecasts, and evaluating with error metrics.
